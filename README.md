# Realtime Chat Application

This is a **Realtime Chat Application** built using modern web technologies. The app allows users to join chat rooms and communicate with others in real-time. It is powered by **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**, with user data stored in **MongoDB**.

## Features

- **Join Chat Rooms**: Users can join specific chat rooms by entering their username and room name.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are instantly updated across all connected clients.
- **User List Management**: Displays the list of users in each chat room and updates dynamically when users join or leave.
- **Server-side Data Management**: User data is stored and managed efficiently using MongoDB.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly UI for both desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Socket.IO Client**: For real-time communication with the server.

### Backend:

- **Node.js**: For handling server-side logic.
- **Express**: For creating APIs and managing routes.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data persistently.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Configure a cloud MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) and update `MONGO_URI` in `.env`.
2. Deploy the backend server to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Vercel).
3. Deploy the frontend to a static hosting platform (e.g., Netlify or Vercel).
